   {
       I have a diverse background in test and QA, both for software and
       hardware.  I have extensive experience and expertise in test automation.
       I have gained my skills by building test frameworks with focus on
       mainlines and integration of automation into a agile software
       development life cycle. During my career, I have successfully identified
       test scenarios that are best suited for automation and the knowledge to
       when manual testing is more effective.

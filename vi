        Hi,

        I came across your job posting on LinkedIn and found it highly relevant to my expertise. With
        over a decade of experience in testing and automation, I have taken on responsibilities that align
        closely with a Test Lead role, including developing test strategies, leading automation
        initiatives, and driving quality improvements across teams and organizations.

        Throughout my career, I have worked extensively in both software and hardware testing. My
        experience includes developing test automation frameworks (Robot Framework), conducting
        exploratory testing, and improving test coverage at companies such as Kambi and PwC.
        Additionally, I have led large-scale automation projects for the Swedish Prosecution
        Authority and Tele2, where I defined test strategies for both individual teams and the
        organization as a whole. A key aspect of these projects was mentoring and training teams in
        testing methodologies, agile processes, and best practices, ensuring a structured and efficient
        approach to quality assurance.

        I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss how my skills align with your needs. I am
        available for an interview at your convenience and can be reached at +46 705-86 94 08 or
        staffan.bjornson@toor.se.


        \vspace{2em}
        Best regards,\\
        Staffan Björnson

# Staffan Bj√∂rnson CV
Hi my name is Staffan and this is my CV. I'm a test automaton specialist from
Sweden. Feel free to download my CV as a PDF or the whole code in LaTex. 

## The Class 
If you want to use the class for your own CV it's perfectly fine. For now the
Makefile is setup so it looks for a sobCV file but it's quite easy to change
for your purposes.

Sincerely Staffan

## Building

you have one installed you can run the following command to build the CV.

```bash
make
```

## Dependencies

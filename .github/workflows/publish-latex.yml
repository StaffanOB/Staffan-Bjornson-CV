# This Action autogenerates PDFs and standalone HTML 
# out of your Overleaf projects (or any LaTeX-live project).
# 
# PDF  generator: pdflatex
# 
# Both tools come from LaTeX Live and are executed on 
# the latest version of Ubuntu.
# 
#    Given:
#       A repository with a LaTeX project with sobCV.tex in the root folder
#   
#    On every push:
#       This GitHub Action builds the project with LaTeX Live. 
#       A   PDF version of sobCV.tex is uploaded to a Release called "Current." 
#           (Make sure that release exists first)
